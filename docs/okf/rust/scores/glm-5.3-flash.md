## Per-tag subscores

| tag | subscore | n | trust | action |
|-----|---------:|--:|-------|--------|
| ownership | 1.00 | 4 | ok | omit (strong) |
| borrowing | 1.00 | 5 | ok | omit (strong) |
| lifetimes | 1.00 | 4 | ok | omit (strong) |
| traits | 1.00 | 5 | ok | omit (strong) |
| error-handling | 1.00 | 4 | ok | omit (strong) |
| iterators | 1.00 | 4 | ok | omit (strong) |
| smart-pointers | 1.00 | 4 | ok | omit (strong) |
| concurrency | 1.00 | 4 | ok | omit (strong) |
| async | 0.71 | 3 | low-n | **derive** (mark low-n) |
| pattern-matching | 1.00 | 4 | ok | omit (strong) |

`subscore = Σ(normalized×weight) / Σ(weight)` over that tag's questions.

async detail: (3×0.67 + 2×1.00 + 2×0.50) / 7 = 5.0 / 7 = 0.71. Only three
questions carry the tag, so a single dropped rubric point swings it; the two
misses are the same shape (correct effects, missing the underlying
mechanism/reason), which is why it is still derived rather than dismissed as
noise.

## Stack score

```
stack_score = Σ(normalized×weight) / Σ(weight) = 67.0 / 69 = 97.1%
```

## Derivation targets

Tags below threshold (`< 0.75`): **async** (low-n) → feed into
`derived/rust.glm-5.3-flash.SKILL.md`. All other tags scored 1.00 and are
intentionally omitted from the derived skill.
