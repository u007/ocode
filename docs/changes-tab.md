# Changes Tab

The **changes tab** is a per-session TUI surface that lists every file the
current chat session has added or edited (main agent + sub-agents), shows a
unified diff per file against its pre-session state, and offers undo for
the entire file or for the most recent tool call on a file.

The list is **not git-based** — it derives from the existing
`internal/snapshot.Store` (every write/edit/patch/delete tool backs up the
file before mutating) plus a small pre/post-stat hook on the bash tool that
detects file mutations made by the shell directly.

## How it works

1. **Snapshot store (`internal/snapshot.Store`).** Every tool that modifies
   a file (`write`, `edit`, `multi_edit`, `multi_file_edit`, `replace_lines`,
   `delete`, `patch`, `formatter`) calls `Store.Backup(path, toolCallID)`
   **before** mutating. The backup is written to disk at
   `<GlobalDataDir>/project/{slug}/snapshots/`. A metadata record
   (`{OriginalPath, BackupPath, ToolCallID, AgentStep, Timestamp, ...}`) is
   kept in memory.

2. **Changes registry (`internal/changes.Registry`).** On `Agent.New`, a
   `Registry` is constructed and attached to the agent's snapshot store.
   Sub-agents spawned via the `task` tool share the same store
   (`subagent.go:300`), so their writes are captured without extra plumbing.

3. **Bash detection (`internal/changes/bash.go`).** A `StatBashRecorder`
   runs a pre/post stat-walk around the bash tool's execution. It compares
   file mtime/size before and after, then intersects with path-shaped tokens
   extracted from the command string. Detected changes are added to the
   registry with `Undoable: false`.

4. **TUI changes model (`internal/tui/changes_model.go`).** The `changesModel`
   calls `Registry.List()` on every render to get the current file list.
   The left pane renders a `ListBox`-powered file list; the right pane
   renders a unified diff of the selected file (via shelling to `diff -u`).

## Data model

```go
// FileChange is one row in the changes tab. All writes to the same file
// in the session are merged into one entry.
type FileChange struct {
    OriginalPath    string         // absolute path
    Status          FileStatus     // Added | Modified | Deleted
    FirstBackupPath string         // "" for files created in-session
    Undoable        bool           // false for bash-only entries
    UndoAllTCID     string         // first tool call id; used for "undo all"
    ChangeCount     int            // number of tool calls touching this file
    Authors         []ChangeAuthor // ordered: main first, then sub-agents
    CreatedAt       time.Time
    UpdatedAt       time.Time
    LastBashCommand string         // the most recent write from bash, when it is the row's newest event
    LastBashExitCode int
}
```

## Status semantics

`FileStatus` (Added / Modified / Deleted) is derived from the **live
filesystem** at render time, not from a stored op flag: the registry runs an
`os.Stat` per row on every `List()` and re-derives the status each time.
This is load-bearing for interleaved snapshot/bash sequences — a file that a
bash `rm` deleted is re-derived as Modified as soon as a newer snapshot
write or an undo puts it back on disk, instead of lingering as `-` forever.

Bash metadata (`LastBashCommand`, `LastBashExitCode`, `UpdatedAt`) is merged
into a snapshot-backed row **only when the bash event is at least as recent
as the newest snapshot for that path** — `LastBashCommand` documents the
write that came most recently from bash, so an older bash touch must not
claim a row a newer snapshot write owns. Deleting a file via bash does not
remove its snapshot backups, so such rows stay `Undoable`; if an undo then
consumes every snapshot, the row falls back to bash-only (non-undoable) and
`Status` reflects whatever the filesystem currently says.

## Undo semantics

- **`u` (undo file):** Calls `Registry.UndoFile(path)` which walks every
  attached snapshot store, collects all tool call IDs for the path, sorts
  them newest-first (LIFO), and calls `Store.UndoByToolCallID` on each.
  The LIFO order satisfies the conflict guard in the snapshot store (it
  refuses if a newer active write still exists). After all calls are
  undone, the file matches its pre-session state.

- **`U` (undo block):** Calls `Registry.LatestToolCall(path)` to find the
  most recent tool call, then `Registry.UndoBlock(path, tcid)` to restore
  that single call's snapshot.

- **Bash-only entries** are not undoable from the tab (`Undoable: false`).
  They have no snapshot backup to restore from. The user sees a status-bar
  message: "this file's only change came from a bash command and cannot be
  undone from the changes tab."

## Bash detection limits (v1)

The pre/post stat-walk is conservative:
- Skips `.git/`, `node_modules/`, `.opencode/`, `build/`, `dist/`.
- Intersects the stat diff with path-shaped tokens extracted from the
  command string (paths after `>`, `>>`, `tee`, `sed -i`, `mv`, `cp`,
  `rm`, `mkdir -p`, `touch`, `cat <<EOF >`).
- Misses: commands that touch files through the command's subprocesses
  (e.g. `make`), renames without a rename pattern, files modified via
  soft links outside the working dir.
- V2 may upgrade to FSNotifier (inotify/FSEvents) if the heuristic
  proves insufficient.
